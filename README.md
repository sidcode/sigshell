sigshell
============

A basic Shell for Linux, built from the ground up to learn about Process management at University. And yes, it is free of shellshocks. 

We intend this to be a learning experience for amateurs wanting to try their hands at UNIX system programming.

Nothing big like bash, zsh .etc Just two geeks trying to have fun.

Feel free to fork and fool around
